# QuickLingo – Focus on fast, daily language learning

## About (English)

• About Me: I’m a mobile engineer (iOS, Flutter primarily, also Android) with years of experience. I’m an indie developer working on open-source apps alongside my full-time job. My goal is to create open-source apps that are useful for students, interns, and freshers (others are welcome too!). Anyone interested can join me in developing these projects.

• Benefits of joining:

1. Students, interns, and freshers will gain real project experience and improve their skills (which can fill to CV, resume, etc,...).
2. Pursue your passion for coding, and do something you love (if you’re as passionate about coding as I am).
3. Build relationships, create a community, and support each other in work and personal growth.

• App QuickLingo: Supports learning new languages, starting with English (more languages will be added later).

## Tech Stack (temporary)

•   Mobile App (Flutter): Bloc Pattern, Provider, etc.

•   Architecture: Clean Architecture.

•   Backend (Firebase): Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Storage, Cloud Functions.

•   AI API (ChatGPT): Normal prompts for generating language learning content.

## Core Features

Using AI API to create language learning content:

1. Initial English Level Test (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.): Users can take a 20-question test to determine their current level.
2. Daily Micro-learning: Generate 4–8 questions tailored to the user’s level for daily practice.
3. Weekly Test: A new weekly test allows users to check their progress and update their level if necessary.
